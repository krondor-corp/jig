**Multiply yourself across parallel agent sessions.**

Git worktree manager for orchestrating Agentic Coding Assistants in parallel. Scale your skills across multiple AI coding sessions—spend your time deciding *what* to build, not the minutiae of *how*.

**[Read the wiki](https://jig.krondor.org)** for background, concepts, and workflow guides.

## Features

- **Simple commands** - Create, list, open, and remove worktrees with short commands
- **Auto-isolation** - Worktrees stored in `.jig/` (automatically git-ignored)
- **Configurable base branch** - Set per-repo or global default base branch
- **On-create hooks** - Run setup commands automatically after worktree creation
- **Shell integration** - Tab completion for commands and worktree names
- **Multi-agent workflow** - Spawn parallel agent sessions with tmux integration
- **Event-driven orchestration** - JSONL event logs track worker lifecycle, derive state, and trigger actions
- **Daemon loop** - Background orchestrator monitors workers, nudges idle/stuck sessions, and sends notifications
- **GitHub integration** - Detect CI failures, merge conflicts, and review comments via `gh` CLI
- **Live dashboard** - `jig ps --watch` shows real-time worker status with event-derived state

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krondor-corp/jig/main/install.sh | bash
```

Then add shell integration to your profile:

```bash
# For bash (~/.bashrc)
eval "$(jig shell-init bash)"

# For zsh (~/.zshrc)
eval "$(jig shell-init zsh)"
```
