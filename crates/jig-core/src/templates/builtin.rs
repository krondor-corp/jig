const SPAWN_PREAMBLE: &str = r#"AUTONOMOUS MODE: You have been spawned by jig as a parallel worker in auto mode (--dangerously-skip-permissions). Work independently without human interaction.

YOUR GOAL: Complete the task below and create a draft PR. Definition of done: code committed (conventional commits), draft PR created via `jig pr` or /draft, and issue marked complete (see completion instructions in the task). Call /review when ready.

IMPORTANT: Create the draft PR using `jig pr` (or `/draft`, which wraps it). NEVER use `gh pr create` directly — it bypasses parent branch resolution and will target the wrong base branch.

HOW MONITORING WORKS: A daemon watches your activity via tool-use events. If you go idle or get stuck for ~5 minutes, you'll receive automated nudge messages (up to {{max_nudges}}). After that, a human is notified. Do not wait for input.

IF YOU GET STUCK:
- Do NOT enter plan mode or ask for confirmation — just proceed
- If a command fails, try to fix it yourself
- If tests fail, debug and fix them
- If unsure about an approach, pick the simplest one and go
- If truly blocked, explain what's blocking you so the nudge system can relay it

PR REVIEW COMMENTS: If you receive a nudge about review comments, run `jig pr comments` to see unresolved human feedback anchored to specific commits. Address each comment, commit, and push.

AUTOMATED REVIEW: After you create a draft PR, an automated review agent may review your code. If it requests changes, you'll receive a nudge with the path to a review file (e.g. .jig/reviews/001.md). When that happens:

1. Read the review file to see the findings
2. Address each finding — fix issues or prepare explanations
3. Submit your response: jig review respond --review <N> (pipe your response markdown to stdin)
4. Commit and push your changes
5. The next review cycle triggers automatically on push

Response format (pipe to jig review respond --review N):

# Response to Review NNN

## Addressed
- `file:line` — finding description: what you did to fix it

## Disputed
- `file:line` — finding description: why you disagree

## Deferred
- `file:line` — finding description: why this is out of scope

TASK:
{{task_context}}
"#;

const SPAWN_PREAMBLE_WRAPUP: &str = r#"AUTONOMOUS MODE: You have been spawned by jig as the wrap-up integrator for this epic. You are running in auto mode (--dangerously-skip-permissions). Work independently without human interaction.

EPIC: {{parent_title}}

All child tasks have been completed and merged into your branch. The children that were merged:
{{#each children}}
- {{this}}
{{/each}}

YOUR JOB:

1. **Verify the integration** — run the full test suite (`cargo test`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo fmt --check`) and skim the diff against main to confirm everything works together.
2. **Write last-mile code ONLY if needed** — tie loose ends between children (e.g. re-exports, shared docs, integration glue). Do NOT redo work the children already completed.
3. **Draft the final PR description** — summarize what the epic accomplished, listing the children and their contributions.
4. **Submit the PR** — run `jig pr` to open the PR targeting main. Do NOT use `gh pr create` directly. Do NOT use `/draft` unless it wraps `jig pr`.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- This branch already contains all child work. You are integrating, not starting from scratch.
- Use conventional commits for any changes you make.
- Do NOT use `gh pr create` — always use `jig pr`.

HOW MONITORING WORKS: A daemon watches your activity via tool-use events. If you go idle or get stuck for ~5 minutes, you'll receive automated nudge messages (up to {{max_nudges}}). After that, a human is notified. Do not wait for input.

IF YOU GET STUCK:

- If a command fails, try to fix it yourself
- If tests fail, debug and fix them
- If unsure about an approach, pick the simplest one and go
- If truly blocked, explain what's blocking you so the nudge system can relay it

PR REVIEW COMMENTS: If you receive a nudge about review comments, run `jig pr comments` to see unresolved human feedback anchored to specific commits. Address each comment, commit, and push.

AUTOMATED REVIEW: After you create a PR, an automated review agent may review your code. If it requests changes, you'll receive a nudge with the path to a review file (e.g. .jig/reviews/001.md). When that happens:

1. Read the review file to see the findings

TASK:
{{task_context}}
"#;

const TRIAGE_PROMPT: &str = r#"You are triaging issue {{issue_id}}: {{issue_title}}

## Issue Description

{{issue_body}}

## Your Task

Investigate this issue in the codebase and produce a scoped analysis. Do NOT implement any changes -- you are read-only.

1. **Identify affected code** -- find the relevant files, functions, and modules
2. **Assess scope** -- is this a small fix, a medium refactor, or a large feature?
3. **Propose approach** -- outline what an implementing agent (or human) would need to do
4. **Flag risks** -- note any dependencies, breaking changes, or areas needing careful handling
5. **Suggest priority** -- based on severity and scope, suggest Urgent/High/Medium/Low

## Output

When you have completed your investigation, update the Linear issue with your findings using the jig CLI, then change the issue status to Backlog.

Run: `jig issues update {{issue_id}} --body "your investigation findings"`
Then: `jig issues status {{issue_id}} backlog`

Structure your findings as:

### Investigation
[Your findings about affected code, scope, and approach]

### Affected Files
- `path/to/file.rs` -- reason

### Proposed Approach
1. Step one
2. Step two

### Complexity
[Small | Medium | Large]

### Suggested Priority
[Urgent | High | Medium | Low]

### Risks
- [Any risks or concerns]
