## v0.5.0 (2026-02-13)

### Chore

 - <csr-id-72ff9fcf89d38f5e74d6d06c128226d2f094feb1/> bump version to 0.5.0
 - <csr-id-d38e493e16a264b81885608389452aa889ddfc6b/> remove jig-tui crate and wt references
   - Remove jig-tui crate entirely (was just a stub)
   - Remove Tui command from CLI
   - Rename all wt references to jig throughout codebase
   - Remove outdated wiki docs and spawn guides
   - Remove deprecated .claude/commands (replaced by skills)
   - Update tests to use jig binary name and init claude arg
   - Remove wt.toml (replaced by jig.toml)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-a685a48ac6c1b1d693e440d4e565e0bbd3ea49c0/> add worktree.copy for gitignored files
   Adds `worktree.copy` config to copy gitignored files (like .env)
   to new worktrees:
   
   ```toml
   [worktree]
   copy = [".env", ".env.local"]
   ```
   
   Files are copied after worktree creation, before on_create hook runs.
 - <csr-id-823eeb1a83ac668fe54b7dbb28a0d062c4f91e9a/> add worktree config to jig.toml
   jig.toml now supports worktree configuration:
   - `worktree.base` — base branch for new worktrees (overrides global)
   - `worktree.on_create` — command to run after worktree creation
 - <csr-id-4c9f3184c27cab9ddfc835fdde711ba6af2539ca/> improve adapter architecture and audit templates
   Adapter improvements:
   - Add AgentType enum for compile-time safe matching
   - Rename template to PROJECT.md (agent-agnostic name)
   - Dynamic audit prompt uses adapter.project_file and adapter.skills_dir
   - Validate agent is installed before init (warns if not in PATH)
   - Fix settings.json schema URL
   
   Template improvements:
   - Fix settings.json to use correct schemastore.org URL
   - Add WebFetch, WebSearch, mcp__*, jig:* to default permissions
   - Update review skill to check jig-specific docs and skills
   - Update issues skill to reference issues/README.md
 - <csr-id-60460d876900a1fca4dda6e7763127965d7dcb50/> add agent-agnostic adapter architecture
   - Add adapter module with AgentAdapter struct for pluggable agent support
   - jig init now requires agent argument: `jig init claude`
   - jig.toml stores agent type in [agent] section
   - spawn command uses adapter to build agent-specific commands
   - Move settings.json to templates/adapters/claude-code/
   
   This architecture allows future support for other agents (cursor, etc.)
   by adding new adapter constants.
 - <csr-id-0ab34082c061a8ffba63413c3a6b7e397d12de6f/> rewrite health check to validate repo setup and agent scaffolding
   Replace terminal-detection-focused health check with structured validation
   of system deps (git, tmux, claude), repository config (jig.toml, base
   branch, .worktrees), and agent scaffolding (CLAUDE.md, settings, skills).
   Remove unused jq/gh dependency checks and dead required field. Exit
   non-zero when checks fail.
